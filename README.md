# Commerce Carousel

An opinionated carousel for react apps

<img src="./art/carousel.jpg" height="200px" width="300px" />

## Motivation

Customizable carousel libraries comes at a price of increased bundle size even if we don't use most of the provided features. Also, not all of them can completely fulfil our requirements and we end up applying some hacks over it to make it work for us.

This is intended to be built for only organizational needs and to be used in products which have the same design and functional requirements.

## Features

- Supports dynamic update of total number of slides.
- Supports horizontal scroll when js is not loaded. (Works in AMP)
- Reacts to touch and swipe events across all devices.
- Supports callback for slide change.
- A lot of ideas and implementation is derived from [slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) and[react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick)
